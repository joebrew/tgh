# tb_catastrophic_costs
Calculating catastrophic costs for tuberculosis

## Conversa amb l'Alberto (18 gener 2016)

$100,000 to do entire study
4-6 months for data collection
Money to do 27 clusters

### Background  

- National control program is a vertical program from the MoH, with offices in every single district  
- Mozambique divided into 3 different areas (northern, central, southern)

- Mozambique divided into 10 provinces (3 provinces per area)

- Every province has around 8-10 districts  

- Every district has 1 or 2 offices for the National Control Program of Tuberculosis and around 10 peripheral health care centers that offer TB treatment

- Each cluster needs to be the health care centers that provide treatments (interviews conducted there)

- For example, in distrito de manhiÃ§a there are 10 places they can receive treatment

- There is no data on the number of people currently being treated at the sub-district (ie, "cluster" level)

- First, stratify by province, then select one province per region, then 2 or 3 districts per province, then within each of those districts select the largest health center (usually the district hospital, which also supplies MDR treatment) plus 2 nearby peripheral basic health centers

- The limitation is that some of these peripheral health care centers do not recruit enough people to get the sample size that we want.  Therefore, a criteria for them will be a minimum number of patients per time.  These will be randomly selected, but if not meeting minimum number of patients, randomly select another. 

## Numbers  

- Overall idea was to recruit around 600 patients in 27 clusters (9 clusters per province, 3 locations in 3 districts in each province) -> 540

- Concern: that 540 is not enough given the original protocol's level of power/precision.  

- Alberto should "assume" that the proportion of households facing catastrophic costs

- Repeat the calculations for 10, 20 and 30%, to see the relative precision.  

- Relative precision maxiumum = 0.2  

- Can we achieve that precision with the sample size we have?  Do we need to change sample size or gamme (5%, 10%, 20%)

- Do the same tables at 0.10, 0.2, 0.3 for gamma

- How do we take into account that there will be differences in notification rates by provinces/districts?  Do we need to recruit more from different areas based on different prevalence?  

- The likelihood of being selected as a cluster should be a function of the total number of cases from that cluster previously (like what they did in Myanmar)

-- Use the Excel files for this (going down to district-level).  

-- Adjust sample size strategy so that it takes into account the different notification rates for each district

- Final product: a document similar to Aina's, but without different scenarios.  Basically, a methods section explaining how we came up with sample size, how we're going to select, limitations, etc.
